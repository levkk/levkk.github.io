# Moving to the Valley from Canada

Hi. I'm a 27 year old software developer who moved from Montreal to Oakland, California.
I did that by myself, with a job offer in-hand. I'll document my experience here.

## Getting a visa
Getting a visa to work in the U.S. is easy if you have
- a university degree in an engineering field or related,
- a job offer for a position in that field.

The visa you will be getting is called TN (or TN status). You get it by showing up at the border, usually
an airport, and asking for it from a CBP agent (Customers & Border Patrol). It costs $52. If your employer knows what they are doing,
they will prepare a packet for you with all the documentation. You want the following documents:

- the job offer detailing your compensation, exact occupation and responsabilities,
- a letter of support from your future employer specifying that this is a temporary position,
- supporting documentation explaining what the company does; this can include news articles, etc.

My employer prepared all the papers in a professional looking packet. I was pretty confident about it, but imagine my surprise
when the border agent said I was missing the actual offer of employment. Lucky for me, I had it on my phone and she was nice enough
to accept reading from it. Almost turned me around on a technicality. My mom kept texting me while I was sitting there contemplating
my travel the world plan B, so the agent might of seen those and let me through. I'd like to think that was why, anyway.

One big stamp in my passport, a nerve wrecking 2 hours, and a handshake later, I was through, with a work permit for the next 3 years.

## Finding a place to live
No matter where you're coming from, rent in the Bay area is the highest you will ever pay. Unless you're from London. Or Singapore, I hear.
You won't be able to afford your own apartment. Maybe a studio, if you want to give up 2-3 thousand dollars a month. But if you're an engineer,
or any one else who gets paid more than most people living here, you would want housemates. Sometimes even roommates. Just to be clear, housemates are
people who share your appartment or house. Roommates are people who share your room. In the Bay area, those words that used to be synonyms in my mind
have now a different meaning.

I was lucky and I didn't have to look very far. I am a big traveler and I try to make friends everywhere I go. I made a friend in a basement of a hostel
in London a couple years ago, and we kept in touch. He had a room for me when I arrived. Well, half of it anyway, but that was better than my own plan
of spending a couple weeks in a hostel and figuring it out later. Seven months later, I still live in that room. Maybe I like that it's in the middle of a small forest,
in the Oakland hills, and that my landlord has a waterfall that he built himself, and a giant rock that was probably there since the ice age. California is beautiful.

## Weather
It never rains in the Summer. It rains 4 times a week in the "Winter". It's really nice, but somehow you still get cold even though it never drops below 12. If you
want to see snow, drive 3 hours east into the Sierra mountains. California has all climates in one state, it's a privillege.
One thing about using Celsius, is that you can't really make small talk: how do you complain about the weather if people say it's 60 degrees and you say it's actually 15?
Everyone I talk to thinks America should be using Celsius, but no one does.

## Money
Everything is expensive here. Food and drinks. And it's pretty hard to find *good* food. I came from a multicultural city you; never had to leave to visit the world. And it would cost you $8. Here, the same thing is $16. Try not to think about it, it might taste better.
